Roderika ist ein NPC Tip: Talk to her several times when you find her at Stormhill Shack until she gives you the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes.

Introduction

    "Everyone's...been grafted. Everyone who came with me.
    They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me.
    Heh... Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken.
    Even their heads...taken. Taken and stuck to the spider.
    Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid.
    It's quite the lark, when you think about it."

When visiting at Stormhill Shack

    "You're all on your own, are you? And heading to Stormveil Castle?
    Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose.
    Oh, you've come to be one with the spider?
    Well, that makes us two peas in a pod. But I don't have your courage.
    It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head.
    I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared.
    I'm nothing but a craven."
    "It was a pleasure to see you.
    Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle?
    Tell them I love them. And that, despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.
    I'm finally getting the hang of this whole "pain" thing, you know."
    "Oh, I know. Can you take this little one along with you?"
    [Gives you the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes]
    "The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself...
    And the spirits look rather fondly upon you.
    It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un".
    "A pleasure to see you.
    Did you give the little chrysalids the message?
    That I love them. And that, despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough".

Upon receiving Chrysalids' Memento

    "What's this? A keepsake? From my men?
    Oh, goodness me... I can't... They all...believed in me.
    They all thought I'd make something of myself. Me! Who can't do anything...
    I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold. Perhaps I'll find my purpose there".

Upon attacking / rolling / jumping

    "You're willing to make me a chrysalid? Ah, but I'm still a milksop craven... I can't even govern myself to step beyond the bounds of this ward. Please. You're only wasting your strength."
    "I know you you must feel. But please, I'm not ready. Or are you like me? You're so far out of your mind with fear? You've divested yourself of all reason?"
    "Please stop. Even if you persist, your fear will not abate."

At Roundtable Hold

    "Greetings. Nice to see you again.
    My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner. Isn't this place impressive, though?
    The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.
    I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.
    Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth. I'm still looking for my own purpose".
    "Oh, and... Please, allow to me to express my thanks. For giving me that keepsake from my men.
    It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn. You have my gratitude.
    Please, take this".
    [Gives you x1 Golden Seed]
    It's all a bit much for me, in truth.
    I'm still looking for my own purpose.

After asking Smithing Master Hewg about her

    "A pleasure to see you. Thank goodness you're safe. I'm still looking for my own purpose.
    It's not easy, by any means, but it's what I must do."
    (Tell her what the blacksmith said) "You're telling me I possess some kind of gift? I don't believe you. But...
    If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first...
    I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I? I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.
    Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished...
    But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So...
    I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all".
    "If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would be a surprise...
    I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I? I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me".

Next visit after asking Smithing Master Hewg to take care of her

    "Good to see you again. Thank you very much!
    I have you to thank, don't I? For persuading Master Hewg?
    I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.
    I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish, but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try.
    And if there's an chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted..
    Well, I certainly must try.
    Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance".

Please (only available if you didn't receive the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes in Stormhill)

    "I'd like to ask you a small favour. Can you take this little one along with you?
    They can't be summoned here. But the spirits look rather fondly upon you.
    It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un."
    [Gives you Spirit Jellyfish Ashes]

After a certain amount of Spirit Tuning

    "I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.
    I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to...
    Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer
    Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner".

When visiting at Roundtable Hold

    "Greetings. Are you here for spirit tuning?"

After burning the Erdtree

    "Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.
    Don't worry, I don't blame you. I'll continue sprit tuning just the same as before.
    Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave.
    His roots are so knotted in this place. He won't last much longer if he stays here...
    His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now. 
    It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him"

Next visit after speaking to Smithing Master Hewg

    "So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either.
    You have my thanks, regardless.I'll try and talk him round next time.
    I know he was given this great entreaty; to craft a weapon which could slay a god.
    Though I can't help but think of it as a curse. A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.
    And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do"

After completing Crumbling Farum Azula and speaking to Hewg

    "Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to... To think he'd forget who you were, as well.
    I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.
    I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.
    But maybe it's better that we don't. It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay."
    "I'll remain with Hewg. He made me who I am today.
    I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can."
    "Please, become Elden Lord. Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him.
    So slay her, with the weapons he smithed. Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all."

There's something you should know (the first time Dung Eater visits the Roundtable Hold)

    "A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.
    And I can hear, from Tip: Talk to her several times when you find her at Stormhill Shack until she gives you the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes.

About the spirits' voices (after Dung Eater's quest ends and he leaves the Roundtable Hold for a second time)

Bewegt sich zu Roundtable Hold, nachdem er ihr das Memento der Chrysaliden gegeben hat ODER sich an einem Ort der Gnade in der Region Liurnia of the Lakes ausruht. Der frühestmögliche Auslöser für den Erwerb von Roderikas Goldenem Samen ist das Ausruhen bei der Anmut der Lake-Facing Cliffs.
Dieser Händler kann nicht bekämpft werden
Roderika reiste mit drei anderen Gefährten, doch sie alle starben während der Reise, um Roderika zu beschützen. Ihr Inneres kann beim Grafted Sifon Boss zersägt werden. Roderika wurde im Hutt mit einem Schutzzauber allein gelassen, damit ihr nichts passieren konnte
