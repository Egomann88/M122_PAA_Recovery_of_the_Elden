She is found standing near a treasure chest within the Waypoint Ruins in the central-east part of Limgrave. Players can reach her after defeating the  Mad Pumpkin Head. After defeating the boss, the Site of Grace "Waypoint Ruins Cellar" appears in their boss room, allowing easy access to Sellen's services. Map Link for Waypoint Ruins.
Sorceress Sellen can also be found kept prisoner at Witchbane Ruins, however, other than speaking to her, nothing can be done with her here until progressing far enough into her quest line. Be warned, attacking Sellen here can cause issues with her availability as a merchant elsewhere and stall progression in her quest line.
This can be resolved by seeking absolution at the Church of Vows.
Map Link for Witchbane Ruins.
She can be summoned to aid in the Red Wolf of Radagon boss fight, after progressing her quest line to the point that she leaves for the Raya Lucaria Academy.
Once the player has progressed her quest line far enough, two new summon signs will appear at the entrance to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library, offering the player a choice between assisting her (gold sign) or challenging her (red sign)
